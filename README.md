# SMS-Email-Spam-Classifier-using-Machine-Learning-NLP-
This project is a Machine Learning–based SMS and Email Spam Classifier built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model preprocesses raw text data through tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming, followed by feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF.

Multiple Naive Bayes models were trained and evaluated, including Multinomial, Bernoulli, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, with Multinomial Naive Bayes achieving the best performance. The application is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to classify messages in real time as Spam or Ham.
